# Crisis Pregnancy Centers in Idaho
## (a.k.a., fake abortion clinics)

Abortion is health care.

Crisis pregnancy centers are a tool of proponents of forced birth. They masquerade as abortion clinics, but spread misinformation about abortion. It's a little like if you needed dialysis, looked up dialysis clinics, and found something called Crisis Dialysis, where the staff, which did not include any doctors, told you lies about the medical risks of dialysis and told you you would regret the procedure.

Because search engine results for abortion clinics often include crisis pregnancy centers, this site contains a map of known crisis pregnancy centers in Idaho. If you need actual health care, avoid these places.
